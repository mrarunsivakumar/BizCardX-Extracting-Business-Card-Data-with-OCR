# BizCardX-Extracting-Business-Card-Data-with-OCR

Design the user interface: Create a simple and intuitive user interface using
Streamlit that guides users through the process of uploading the business
card image and extracting its information

Implement the image processing and OCR:Use easyOCR to extract the
relevant information from the uploaded business card image
use image processing techniques like resizing, cropping, and thresholding to
enhance the image quality before passing it to the OCR engine

Display the extracted information:Once the information has been extracted,
display it in a clean and organized manner in the Streamlit GUI

Implement database integration:Use a database management system like
MySQL to store the extracted information along with the uploaded
business card image
use SQL queries to create tables, insert data,
and retrieve data from the database, Update the data and Allow the user to
delete the data through the streamlit UI
